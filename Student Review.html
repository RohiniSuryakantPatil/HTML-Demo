    <hr><h1>Gowtham GM</h1>
    <p><font size="4">After joining Tap Academy, I have 
        improved my programing skills,and my knowledge of core java has also improved.
        Now, I am learning the Collection Framework,MySQL, HTML, and CSS in parallel.
         <br>Through the TAI platform, I have enhanced my problem-solving skills.
         Additionally,the LMS makes it easy to watch all the recorded videos.
        They also provide recorded videos of Framework like J2EE,Spring,Data Structures,etc.
        <br>I got placed in Promantia Business Solutions for the role of Associate Technical Consultant with a package of 3 LPA.
        <br>Thank you TAP ACADEMY for giving me this opportunity.</font>
